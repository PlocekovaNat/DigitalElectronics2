# Lab 2: User library for GPIO control

<!--
![Atmel Studio 7](images/screenshot_atmel_studio_gpio.png)
-->

### Learning objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

* Config input/output ports of AVR using control registers
* Use ATmega328P manual and find information
* Understand the difference between header and source files
* Create your own library
* Understand how to call a function with pointer parameters

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to learn how to create your own library in C. Specifically, it will be a library for controlling GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins with help of control registers.

## Pre-Lab preparation

1. Fill in the following table and enter the number of bits and numeric range for the selected data types defined by C.

   | **Data type** | **Number of bits** | **Range** | **Description** |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
   | `uint8_t`  | 8 | 0, 1, ..., 255 | Unsigned 8-bit integer |
   | `int8_t`   | 8 | -128,..., 127 | Signed 8-bit integer |
   | `uint16_t` | 16 | 0, 1, ..., 65535 | Unsigned 16-bit integer |
   | `int16_t`  | 16 | -32768, ..., 35767 | Signed 16-bit integer |
   | `float`    | 32 | -3.4e+38, ..., 3.4e+38 | Single-precision floating-point |
   | `void`     | depends on size of the system(16,32,64)| - | Represents no value or no output in functions |
