# Lab 6: Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)

## Pre-Lab preparation

1. Use schematic of [Arduino Uno](https://oshwlab.com/tomas.fryza/arduino-shields) and find out on which Arduino Uno pins the UART transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) are located.

2. Remind yourself, what an [ASCII table](http://www.asciitable.com/) is. What codes are defined for control characters `Esc`, `Space`, `Tab`, and `Enter`?
